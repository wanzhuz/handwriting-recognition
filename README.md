# USPS Handwriting Recognition
## Abstract
In todayâ€™s digitalized world, image and pattern recognition play a vital role. This significance stems from their ability to automate
mundane tasks that, although manageable by humans, can be viewed as inefficient uses of their time, such as digit or facial recognition.
The objective of this project is to compare the effectiveness and accuracy of two algorithms: a basic algorithm and an SVD (Singular
Value Decomposition) basis algorithm. Specifically, we aim to automate the identification of handwritten digits using data from the
United States Postal Service (USPS). Automating this task is important because while humans are capable of recognizing digits,
it is a mundane task that becomes prone to errors over time. In contrast, computers can perform this task much faster and with
predetermined accuracy. By finding an image recognition algorithm that performs well, we can accomplish more in less time. This
report explores the effectiveness of these two algorithms in achieving this objective, and we later conclude that SVD performs
significantly better than our simple classification algorithm.
